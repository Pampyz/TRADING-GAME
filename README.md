# TRADING-GAME
The TRADING-GAME investigates different questions posed in the context of a special multiplayer game. The game can be described as the 'economic' game, where actors try to improve their own standing . The game is modelled on an 'austrian' interpretation of value, where every agent have their own valuation of different assets which is not 

We also attempt to model economic time-series using certain emergent features of this game; we are using this framework as an inductive bias on the underlying structure of the time-series. Specifically, we attempt to model exchange rates of different kinds as the result of a multi-player process where each player act on a market

Multi-player games of different kinds are generally characterized by imperfect information (meaning that no single player has access to all knowledge) and hence leads to communication. Furthermore, in this case all players have a different utility - making communication in various ways important to probe the utilities of other agents in order to make good decisions

<h2> Practical setting </h2>
The game consists of <i> actors</i>, each possessing <i>assets</i>, a <i>utility</i>


<h2> Theoretical setting </h2>
Reinforcement learning - setting of a MDP
Agent observes the state, and chooses an action. The state updates and the agent receives a reward.

State transition function:
$p(s_{t+1}|s_{t}, a{t})$



Policy:
$p(a_{t}|s_{t} = \pi(a_{t})$

Partially observable MDP:
Agent gets an observation which is not necessarily the full state of the environment. Otherwise the same - the state is updated based 

Decentralized POMDP:
Multitude of agents!

When they have different rewards function - Partially observable stochastic game.
TRADING GAME is a kind of POSG - where actors attempt
