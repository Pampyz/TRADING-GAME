Agent observes the state, and chooses an action. The state updates and the agent receives a reward.

State transition function:

Policy:
$p(a_{t}|s_{t} = \pi(a_{t})$

Partially observable MDP:
Agent gets an observation which is not necessarily the full state of the environment. Otherwise the same - the state is updated based 

Decentralized POMDP:
Multitude of agents!

When they have different rewards function - Partially observable stochastic game.
TRADING GAME is a kind of POSG - where actors attempt
